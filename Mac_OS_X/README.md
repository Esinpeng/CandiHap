## To Install __`CandiHap.app`__ for Mac OS
If you attempt to open CandiHap.app and macOS stops you from doing so, that doesn't necessarily mean there is something wrong with the app. But it will indicate that the app isn't from an 'identified developer'.</br>
You can open the app and override the block. Here's how:</br>
```
   1. Open System Preferences.
   2. Go to Security & Privacy and select the General tab.
   3. Click on the button 'Open Anyway'.
   4. You’ll be asked one more time, and clicking 'Open'.
```
